            <h2>Streamlit Application for Resume Analysis using NLP and GPT-3.5 turbo (Recruiter Friendly)</h2>
            <p>Technical Synopsis: Streamlit-Powered ATS Resume Matcher with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo</p>
            <p>This project leverages OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5 Turbo language model, seamlessly integrated within a user-friendly Streamlit web app. It utilizes CountVectorizer from Scikit-learn to transform resumes and job descriptions into numerical vectors for calculating cosine similarity and matching suitability. The system can dynamically generate job descriptions for different experience levels (entry, mid, and advanced) and suggest missing keywords to enhance resumes based on the job description, powered by GPT-3.5 Turbo. PyPDF2 library enables processing of PDF resumes, while secure key management safeguards API credentials. This Streamlit-based application significantly optimizes the resume screening process, offering a data-driven and user-friendly approach to talent acquisition for recruiters.</p>
            <p>Skills: Large Language Models (LLM), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Application Programming Interfaces (API), Streamlit</p>
